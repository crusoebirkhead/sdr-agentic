4. Hero Image Concept
   Concept: To avoid generic stock photos, the login page or an empty dashboard state could feature a unique, abstract visual.

Description: A clean, minimalist 3D rendering of interconnected nodes and data streams, rendered in our primary color palette (shades of blue and gray). The visual should represent the flow of data being automatedâ€”from lead capture (a sphere) through processing nodes to an outcome (a calendar icon). The lighting should be soft and professional. This creates a unique brand asset that visually explains the product's purpose.

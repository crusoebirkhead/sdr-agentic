Structured Layouts: A strong grid system to organize information clearly.

Subtle Interactivity: Soft hover animations, gentle shadows, and smooth transitions. Nothing jarring.

High Contrast: Text must be easily readable. Use strong contrast, especially for data and key information.

Professional Color Palette: Primarily monochromatic (blacks, whites, grays) with a single, professional accent color for primary actions and highlights.

3. Typography
